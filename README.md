# SLEAp-for-low-coherent-matrix
This is the implementation code of the paper that is named "Designing Low Coherent Measurement Matrix with Controlled Spectral Norm via an Efficient Approximation of ℓ∞-Norm" in IEEE Signal Processing Letters (SPL) with DOI: 10.1109/LSP.2022.3217721.

The methods of the paper are based on the approximated ℓ∞-Norm (LSEAp) to create low coherent measurement matrix with or without a low spectral norm for 
Compressed Sensing (CS).
